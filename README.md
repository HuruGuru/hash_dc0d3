### Utility Description:

This utility is a simple tool for computing and brute-forcing hashes like Base64, MD5, SHA-256, and bcrypt using dictionary-based attacks. It is designed to efficiently crack hashes or passwords by leveraging precompiled wordlists.

The utility supports various hash types and is recommended for use with the "rockyou" wordlist (or any other comprehensive wordlists), which contains a wide range of commonly used passwords.

**For more complex hashing algorithms and advanced cracking techniques, it is recommended to use Hashcat, a powerful tool optimized for such tasks.**
